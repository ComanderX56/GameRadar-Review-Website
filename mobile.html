        <p>The Call of Duty franchise is no stranger to mobile gaming, but
            the succinctly titled Call of Duty: Mobile is different. While
            I’ve already fought Call of Duty zombies on a phone and even used
            a Nintendo DS stylus to aim down sights (I don’t recommend it)
            in unambitious games designed for the limitations of their
            platforms, this new entry represents a concerted effort from
            Activision to make a mark on the notoriously difficult-to-crack
            and overcrowded mobile market – and it clearly wants to bring
            in people for the long term. You won’t find a campaign,
            but the multiplayer modes are substantial and even
            include a full battle royale. What’s put forth is impressive, but
            the controls are iffy and its free-to-play nature has it reminding
            you about its microtransactions often, even if they are thankfully
            easy to ignore.
        </p>

        <p>Using a touch screen to control a shooter will never be on par with 
            a controller, much less a keyboard and mouse, and you simply cannot 
            avoid that. Aside from the inherent relative lack of speed and 
            precision, you’re also covering up part of the screen with your 
            ingers. With those understandings in place, however, I can say I had 
            a decent time moving and firing in Call of Duty: Mobile. Movement 
            can be somewhat inconsistent with the virtual left control stick, but 
            aiming and firing feels generally okay. Sneaking up on someone and 
            lining up the reticle works, and in the reverse scenario I was able to 
            get my gun up and fire back quickly and in a reliable way. More detailed 
            movement, like vaulting through a window, crouching behind cover, and 
            tossing off a grenade are trickier, thanks to the density of on-screen 
            icons, but standard shooting is satisfying. It exceeded my admittedly 
            low expectations, but that’s not saying much.
