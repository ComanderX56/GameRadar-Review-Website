    <h1>Cyberpunk 2077 Review</h1>

          <p>Early on in Cyberpunk 2077, there's a series of side quests that
            has you tracking down rogue taxis run by faulty AI. You have to 
            talk one of the taxis down from suicide as it contemplates driving
            off a bridge, while another needs to be brute-forced into behaving,
            and a third is an obvious reference to a famous video game AI that
            manipulates you as you chase it down. It's one of the best minor
            questlines in the game, an intriguing and surprisingly human substory
            that rewards you with lots of much-needed cash. It's also an excuse
            to send you to every corner of Night City, a clever introduction to
            all the areas you haven't yet been.</p>

        <br>

        <p>I spent a lot of my playtime following side-quest threads like
          this one, excited about the premise and hoping to find something
          as interesting or fun or rewarding at the end and, in many cases, I
          did. But now, after finishing the main story, I can't see how most
          of those activities fit into the overall narrative or the character
          I was playing. The main story doesn't even gel with itself.</p>
      
          <br>
      
          <p>Cyberpunk 2077 draws heavily from its source material, with
          everything from the world itself to the life and death of
          Johnny Silverhand coming from its pen-and-paper inspiration. 
          But unlike in a tabletop RPG, you aren't playing a role of your
          own creation in Cyberpunk 2077; you're playing V, and this is
          V's story, not yours. I often felt like I was role-playing two
          different characters: one V for the side quests and one more
          limited V for the main story.</p>
